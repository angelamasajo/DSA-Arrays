7. Max sum in the array
You are given an array containing positive and negative integers. 
Write an algorithm which will find the largest sum in a continuous sequence.

Input: [4, 6, -3, 5, -2, 1]
Output: 12


8. Merge arrays
Imagine you have 2 arrays which have already been sorted. Write an algorithm 
to merge the 2 arrays into a single array, which should also be sorted.

Input:[1, 3, 6, 8, 11] and [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]
Output:[1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11]


9. Remove characters
Write an algorithm that deletes given characters from a string. For example, 
given a string of "Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny" and the characters 
to be removed are "aeiou", the algorithm should transform the original string 
to "Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny". Do not use Javascript's filter, split, 
or join methods.

Input:'Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny', 'aeiou'
Output: 'Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny'


10. Products
Given an array of numbers, write an algorithm that outputs an array where 
each index is the product of all the numbers in the input array except for 
the number at each current index. See the following example input and output.

Input:[1, 3, 9, 4]
Output:[108, 36, 12, 27]


***11. 2D array
Write an algorithm which searches through a 2D array, and whenever it finds 
a 0 should set the entire row and column to 0.

Input:
[[1,0,1,1,0],
[0,1,1,1,0],
[1,1,1,1,1],
[1,0,1,1,1],
[1,1,1,1,1]];
Output:
[[0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,1,1,0],
[0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,1,1,0]];


***12. String rotation
Given 2 strings, str1 and str2, write a program that checks if str2 is a rotation of str1.

Input: amazon, azonma

Output: False

Input: amazon, azonam

Output: true
